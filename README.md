# Object-Detection-Web-App-using-tensorflow-OpenCV-and-Flask

Detecting Objects and finding out their names from images is a very challenging and interesting field of Computer Vision.
The core science behind Self Driving Cars, Image Captioning and Robotics lies in Object Detection.
This model is deployed as an Web App using Flask Framework of Python.

From loading the pre trained dataset, to detecting the objects for labels, to loading the image and then routing and image upload, this web app provides a solid bases for all the technologies including Tensorflow, OpenCV and Flask. 

To imporove the frontend and addition of classes we are accepting Open Source requests as well!
